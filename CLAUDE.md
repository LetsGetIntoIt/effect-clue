# Project conventions

## Package manager

Use `pnpm` for everything. Never `npm`, `yarn`, or `bun`.

## Verification checks

All of these must pass green before every commit:

- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm knip`
- `pnpm i18n:check`

If you amend or update a commit, re-run the full set — a previously-green commit can break after edits.

## Manual verification in the preview

For any change that's observable in the browser, use the `next-dev` preview (configured in `.claude/launch.json`) to exercise the change yourself before reporting the task done. Follow the `<verification_workflow>` from the system prompt: start/reload the preview, check console/network/logs, take a screenshot or snapshot as proof. Don't ask the user to verify manually.

## Tests

Write exhaustive tests for any code you add or modify.

When modifying behavior:

1. Read the existing tests covering that code first.
2. Remove or update tests that assert outdated behavior.
3. Add tests for any previously-uncovered cases the change introduces.
4. Run `pnpm test` and make sure everything passes.

Tests live next to source (`Foo.test.ts(x)` beside `Foo.ts(x)`) — match that pattern.

## PR workflow

- Always open a PR. Never merge directly to `main`.
- Always merge with a **merge commit** — not squash, not rebase.
- Only merge when I explicitly ask. Sometimes I'll ask you to open the PR and I'll merge it myself. If unsure whether to merge, ask.

## Commit message format

- **Title**: imperative mood, under ~70 chars.
- **Body**: lead with a description of the change from the user's perspective. Then describe any technical details. Add any other useful context after that.

## PR title and description format

- **Title**: a cohesive, concise summary that covers all commits in the PR.
- **Description**: lead with the behavior changes from the user's perspective. At the bottom, include a log of the commits with code-oriented technical descriptions of what each one does.
